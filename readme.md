# Story Categorization (Deep Learning)

This research concentrates on the categorization of comments as well as the stories narrated by the victims of 
- Sexual Harassment, Label: 0
- Bullying (Cyber and Social), Label: 1

All the data is written in English language. We are planning to work with Bengali too.

Requirements can be found in the "storynlp-tf.yml" file. Just create a conda environment and install the packages with conda mostly. This file contains only the Tensorflow based dependencies along with the necessary NLP packages (for example: nltk).

Dataset Preprocessing part is uploaded for now and will be gradually updated with the new models.

Only the students of North South University can access this dataset for now. We will open the dataset later for more research works.# Deep-Learning-Based-Story-Categorization
